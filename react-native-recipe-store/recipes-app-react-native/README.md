## Contributions
I used the Recipes App template [here](https://github.com/instamobile/recipes-app-react-native) as a starting point, ultimately changing things about nearly every aspect and adding many features.

I was the primary author of the extensive modifications and additions to the original app template, including new screens, navigations, components, and more.

The exceptions are the onboarding screens, database connection, the cart, and the edit-pinned stores pop-up, which were done mostly by teammember Joshua Ki.
