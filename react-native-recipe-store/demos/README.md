## Notes on other features

Beyond these videos, this app has a few other features worth mentioning.
* Tracking and setting of "Popular Recipes": These show up in the appropriately named sections of Home and Store screens.  They are defined to be either manually set by the stores themselves (via a companion website I designed specifications before but did not implement myself so is not included) allowing them to push certain recipes, and are otherwise filled in by which recipes are most often purchased at each store, which is tracked and updated on user purchases.
* Manually adding of additional ingredients and recipes to store inventory.  In our completed product stores were able to update and add to their inventories through their companion website, and see those updates in this customer facing marketplace.  

While I designed the specifications for the website and helped integrate these features on the back-end, I did not build the website itself, so these features are not included in the code or demonstrations for this portfolio.
