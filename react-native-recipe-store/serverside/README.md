# Recipes App Proxy Server

[index.js](https://github.com/eroosendahl/resume-portfolio/blob/master/react-native-recipe-store/serverside/index.js) contains the ExpressJS proxy that serves the database data to client apps.

## Contributions

I set up the initial ExpressJS server and API endpoint, then designed and requested the subsequent necessary API endpoints from my team, which were implemented primarily by team-member Joshua Ki, with occasional help from Matthew Schlittler and myself.
