# Web Discussion Forum

This was a project in which I built a rapid prototype for an online forum with tools I hadn't used before, with a few additional features I list below.  

## Features:

- Users can register, login, and logout
- Users can view a list of their own discussions
- Users can view a list of all discussions
	The list displays discussion title, like count, and comment count, for each displayed discussion
- Users can create new discussions comprised of a title, an initial link, and an initial comment
- Users can add further links to their own discussion
- Users can view, comment, and like/unlike any discussion
