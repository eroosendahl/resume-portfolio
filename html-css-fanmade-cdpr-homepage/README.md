# Fanmade Website Homepage Redesign

Of course, I am and have never been in any way associated with CDPR - this was just a project I did to practice HTML and CSS.

It includes only the imagined home-page of their website.  The images were found online.  I only take claim for the files index.html, scripts.js, and style.css.
