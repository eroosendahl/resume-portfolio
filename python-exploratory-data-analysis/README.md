# Python Exploratory Data Analysis

This was a simple application of exploratory data analysis I conducted on rideshare data from Uber and Lyft from November 2018.  

This project gave me experience with common DS tools Python, Pandas, and Numpy, as well as general skills like data wrangling and visualization, and the general process of conducting EDA.
